# nullspace

A terminal app for building a personal library of LaTeX equations. Browse, search,
and edit equations and see them rendered as real math inline in your terminal.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.96 or newer (`cargo`).
- For graphical previews, a terminal with image support (kitty, WezTerm, iTerm2,
  Ghostty, or any Sixel-capable terminal). Without one, previews fall back to
  half-block rendering.

## Running

```sh
cargo run -p nullspace-tui
# or
make all
```

Your library is stored locally and persists between runs. By default it lives in
your platform's data directory; set `NULLSPACE_DB` to use a custom path:

```sh
NULLSPACE_DB=/path/to/library.sqlite3 cargo run -p nullspace-tui
```

To launch a disposable demo library:

```sh
make demo
```

## Keybindings

### Browser

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j` / `k` (or `↓` / `↑`) | Move selection |
| `g g` / `G` | Jump to top / bottom |
| `Enter` | Edit the selected equation |
| `n` | New equation |
| `c` | Clone the selected equation |
| `y` | Copy the selected equation's LaTeX to the clipboard |
| `o` | Open the selected equation's first reference link |
| `d` | Delete the selected equation (moves it to the trash) |
| `/` | Search |
| `:` | Command line |
| `+` / `-` | Zoom the preview in / out |
| `v` | Toggle horizontal / vertical pane layout |
| `h` / `l` | Focus the list / preview pane |
| `Esc` | Clear the active filter |
| `?` | Help (full keybinding reference) |
| `q` / `Ctrl-C` | Quit |

Search is broad by default and matches name, description, assumptions, LaTeX,
and tags.
Prefix the query to narrow it:

| Prefix | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `tag:physics` | Tags |
| `var:E` | Variable symbols and descriptions |

While searching, `Tab` switches focus between the query and the result list.

### Command line

`:` opens a command line with completion (`Tab` accepts, `↑`/`↓` select, `Enter`
runs, `Esc` cancels). Commands: `delete`, `exit`, `new`, `openReference`,
`quantities`, `search`, `tags`, `trash`.

- `:tags` lists all tags (plus an *untagged* entry); `Enter` filters the browser
  by the chosen tag.
- `:quantities` lists all quantities with symbol, name, units, and linked-equation
  count; `Enter` filters by quantity, `n`/`e`/`d` manage them.
- `:trash` shows deleted equations; `r` restores, `d` purges permanently.

### Editor

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Next / previous field |
| `Ctrl-S` | Save |
| `Esc` | Back |

In the **Related** field: `r` to choose equations from the library, `Enter` to open
the highlighted relation, `d` to remove it.

In the **References** field: `a` to add a reference, `Enter` to edit the highlighted
one, `o` to open its link, `d` to remove it, `j`/`k` or arrow keys to move. Each
reference has authors, year, title, DOI, URL, and page(s) fields; a bare DOI such
as `10.1103/PhysRev.140.A1133` is automatically turned into a `https://doi.org/...`
link. Existing libraries and JSON files using the old single-line reference format
still import unchanged.

In the **Variables** field: `a` to add a variable (symbol + description), `Enter`
to edit the highlighted one, `d` to remove it, `c` to link all variables to
global quantities (auto-creating unknown symbols and prompting on ambiguous
ones), and `u` to unlink the highlighted variable.

The **Assumptions** field is free text, for notes such as `non-relativistic
limit, T << T_F`; broad search matches it.

### Related picker

Type to fuzzy-search, `Space` to toggle, `Enter` to apply, `Esc` to cancel.

## Import / export

Libraries export as `{ "quantities": [...], "equations": [...] }`. Old bare
equation-array JSON files still import.

```sh
# Export the whole library
cargo run -p nullspace-tui -- --export equations.json   # or: make export

# Import equations from a file
cargo run -p nullspace-tui -- --import equations.json    # or: make import

# Choose how duplicates are handled on import (default: skip)
cargo run -p nullspace-tui -- --import equations.json --on-duplicate overwrite
```
